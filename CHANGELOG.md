# Changelog

## 0.0.1 - Unreleased

- Initialized the codapter workspace, packages, transport layer, and build tooling.
- Added a real Pi subprocess backend with opaque session tracking and JSONL RPC bridging.
- Implemented thread lifecycle, turn streaming, native `command/exec`, and Pi-backed elicitation.
- Added architecture, API mapping, and integration documentation.
- Added smoke-test coverage and dist build verification.
- Added SIGINT/SIGTERM signal handlers to dispose Pi child processes on shutdown.
- Added `CODAPTER_PI_COMMAND` and `CODAPTER_PI_ARGS` env vars for Pi launch configurability.
- Added idle timeout for Pi processes (default 5 min, configurable via `CODAPTER_PI_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`).
- Increased SIGTERM→SIGKILL grace period from 1s to 5s.
- Removed unused declarations in pi-process.ts (parseModelKey, toImageContent, currentModelId, unnecessary async/await).
- Extended per-thread state machine (`starting → ready → turn_active → forking → terminating`) with request buffering during `starting`, rejection during `forking`/`terminating`, and debug-level state transition logging.
